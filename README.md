# Space Titanic: Passenger Transport Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that aims to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension in the "Space Titanic" competition on Kaggle (or a similar platform). The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and prediction generation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   `space_titanic_eda.py`:  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) script. This script performs data cleaning, visualization, and analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and detect potential issues.
*   `space_titanic_train_fe.py`:  Feature Engineering and Training script. This script preprocesses the training data, handles missing values, encodes categorical features, scales numerical features, and trains a machine learning model.
*   `space_titanic_test_fe.py`:  Feature Engineering for Test Data script. This script performs the same feature engineering steps as the training script, but on the test dataset to ensure consistency.
*   `ml_model.py`:  Model Training and Selection script.  This script trains, evaluates, and selects the best machine learning model for prediction. It may include hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
*   `prediction.py`:  Prediction Generation script.  This script loads the trained model, makes predictions on the test data, and saves the predictions to a CSV file suitable for submission to the competition.
*   `titanic_predictions.csv`: The generated CSV file containing the model's predictions on the test dataset. This file is formatted for submission to the competition.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the code in this repository.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Data Source

The training and test data are assumed to be downloaded from Kaggle's Space Titanic competition (or a similar platform). Due to file size constraints and best practices, the data files are *not* stored directly in this repository. Instead, the code reads the data directly from the raw github URLs.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the following Python packages:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (sklearn)
